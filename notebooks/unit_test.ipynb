        "4. (hard, ICSE comprehension level): read through task 5 of achievingmusic and find out how exactly to query the trained encoder and what form will the returned latent vector be in. use this information to make our second input to training the end model i.e. ENCODED_ROLL, hereby referred to as ER.\n",
        "5. (medium) create a pipeline that queries 1 through 4 above to make one entire dataset and stores it. this unit must implement appropriate checkpointing to ensure a lost runtime doesn't waste all my effort.\n",

        "***: [This step involves the choice to do one of two things: (a) repeat the structure of achievingmusic where all the tracks are put into a single csv, this makes it more time efficient but it makes song tracking significantly harder (b) convert each midi into a standalone csv file.this makes input slightly complicated but resolves all other issues. this method may take longer monolithic slabs of work but saves time by not having to work on files that may not be used in our final training process.]"
